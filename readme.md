# SUMMARY

This project is about the 2009 film Fantastic Mr. Fox and its ideas on contentment. The film depicts ambition as an adversary to contentment, leading the titular fox to fall back on the exciting jobs of his youth instead of focusing on the stability of his current life. How does contentment lead to boredom and restfulness, and how is one meant to cope? Is it better to continue with the familiar hand youâ€™re dealt, or risk it all on something exciting?
