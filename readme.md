# SUMMARY

This project is about the 2009 film *Fantastic Mr. Fox* and its ideas on contentment. The film depicts ambition as an adversary to contentment, leading the titular fox to fall back on the exciting jobs of his youth instead of focusing on the stability of his current life. How does contentment lead to boredom and restfulness, and how is one meant to cope? Is it better to continue with the familiar hand you’re dealt, or risk it all on something exciting?
I didn’t grow up with this movie, having only seen it for the first time roughly two years ago. Yet it’s so immediately touching and real, it almost gives you goosebumps. *Fantastic Mr. Fox* is one of the most human narratives I’ve ever watched onscreen, and I wished to talk about an aspect of why that is that I felt was neglected. Most other essays on the movie talk about the familial dynamics or being “different,” while I felt what it says about the struggle of ambition vs contentment and what it brings was far more interesting. 
Using clips from a movie to elucidate my point is endlessly helpful. There’s so much that only words or even just audio can miss. Visuals helped much more than I would’ve originally thought, whether when used as simply part of an audio clip itself or when providing context to what I’m saying. This applies to stock footage as well, which I frankly doubted the effectiveness of. However, that footage greatly helped strengthen points that otherwise would have lacked such a visual. A similar thought process was had with the usage of text, which I originally thought would have been more distracting than anything. In reality, it helps emphasize points in ways my voice alone couldn’t.
Originally, I wasn’t going to include any personal anecdotes. I felt that it would distract more than it could add anything. While working on the essay, however, I quickly realized this wasn’t the case. Using the anecdote about my dad helped flesh out my points and ground it in reality. It made the ideas of contentment and what it could bring I discuss feel more important.
